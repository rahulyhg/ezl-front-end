  <h2 class="animated zoomIn">What are fantasy games?</h2>
  <p class="animated fadeIn">In a traditional fantasy league, there is a set number of “team owners”. There is a set of rules that determine everything from team roster size, to scoring method, to schedule. You and your fellow team owners hold a draft, i.e. fill your fantasy roster
    with real-life players. Then throughout the season, you will set your lineup based on how well you think “your” players will perform. The statistics your players generate in their real games are collected, and fantasy points are awarded based on these
    numbers. The better your players perform, the more fantasy points accrue for your fantasy team. Ultimately, these points determine a winner in the league. The team that accumulated the most points-based wins over the course of the season, or prevails
    in the postseason if set up that way, is declared the league winner. With the league championship comes the glory to boast about it until the next season rolls around, at which point the other teams can smell sweet revenge.</p>

  <h2 class="animated zoomIn">JOINING A STANDARD LEAGUE</h2>
  <p class="animated fadeIn">Standard Vainglory fantasy leagues are twelve-team, standard scoring leagues which use fixed rule settings and are managed by EZL. Leagues play with a head-to-head scoring format which use a 12-week regular season and 4-week playoff bracket system.
    To join a standard league, follow blah blah blah EZL fancy website shenanigans

  <h2 class="animated zoomIn">GENERAL RULES FOR STANDARD LEAGUES</h2>
  <p class="animated fadeIn">To assemble your team, you will draft players from a list of all pro players, from various organizations and tournaments. Selected players in your starting lineup will lock in once they’ve begun their matches, to prevent team owners from switching out
    a poor-performing member once they see them. In order for the draft to proceed, it is required that ALL team ownership slots are filled prior to the draft time. If a draft fails to fire, it will be removed from the system and a new date/time will
    need to be set.
  </p>
  <h2 class="animated zoomIn"> Roster Settings</h2>
  <p class="animated fadeIn"> Teams will supply a list of every player’s position eligibility, prior to the start of each season. Generally speaking, these will be each player’s primary position within the game, although we reserve the right to designate a player differently. Once
    the season begins, the player’s assigned role must remain fixed, even if they play in different roles. Standard League rosters have slots for a total of seven (7) players per team. There are four (4) starting slots. See below for specific starting
    positions.</p>
  <table class="stack">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Roster Size</th>
        <th>Position</th>
        <th>Starter</th>
        <th>Max</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Total Roster Size: 7</td>

        <td>Total Subs: 3</td>
        <td>Captain</td>
        <td>1 starter</td>
        <td>2 Maximum</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

  <p class="animated fadeIn"> You decide which players to start for each day of competition. Your Team page allows you to analyze each of your current players, review their performance (previous day/week, year to date, etc.) and freely move players between your active roster and
    bench. Roster moves involving a player may be made right up until that player’s team is scheduled to begin playing in their game for that scoring period. You may add players via a free agent list or by waivers. You will more than likely need to drop
    a player in order to pick someone up unless you already have an open roster spot available. Waivers work as follows: a team removes a drafted player from their bench. Each team individually has a chance to acquire that player, starting from the lowest-ranked
    team. Once a team passes, the next team in order gets the choice to acquire the player. If a team acquires a waivered player and they are the only ones that claimed that player, their waiver priority is moved to the last slot. If multiple teams claim
    a waivered player, the system checks which team has the highest priority, and that team will win the waiver claim. If a player clears waivers, the player becomes a free-agent who can be added on a first-come, first-serve basis.

  <h2 class="animated zoomIn"> Trades in Standard Leagues</h2>
  <p class="animated fadeIn"> Trades are an agreement between two team owners to exchange one or more players. Trades can be processed with an uneven number of players as long as they do not violate any roster settings. Trading can be the most enjoyable part of the game, but it
    can also be a source of frustration for owners who don't understand certain policies or don't do their research on the player(s) involved in a trade. Trades may be processed up until Thursday, 12pm EST (GMT -5) on the 8th week of the season. Trades
    go through a review period of 24 hours, where the players traded are unavailable to either team. During the trade review period, if five (5) of the twelve (12) team owners vote to veto a trade (to prevent unbalanced trades or collusion between teams),
    the trade will be cancelled. If a trade is made and a player involved in the deal plays a match within the 24 hour review period, the player’s points are ineligible for both the team they were on and the team they are being traded to.</p>

  <h2 class="animated zoomIn"> Scoring Settings for Standard Leagues</h2>
  <p class="animated fadeIn"> Below is a comprehensive list of all scoring categories available for each role in Vainglory. NOTE: bonus categories do not stack. If a player reaches a bonus threshold, they can only achieve one threshold of that bonus type. If a sub performs better
    at their role than your starter in that position, you may choose (within 24 hours of points completion) to add that player’s score to your team’s score instead.
